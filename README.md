# Morghulis

This project is currently facing issues due to the instability of the underlying library. Given these challenges, it necessitates a complete overhaul from the ground up. Unfortunately, I lack the time to rewrite the entire library in C, despite my interest in doing so. Therefore, the project is licensed under the WTFPL, allowing you full freedom to modify and utilize it as you see fit.

It is supposed to be a DE-agnostic simplified configuration.
